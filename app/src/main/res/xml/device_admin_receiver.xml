  Device Admin Policy for IP_Cam
  
  This policy defines the device administration capabilities for IP_Cam when
  set as Device Owner. These policies enable silent app updates and device
  management for dedicated surveillance devices.
  
  Key Capabilities:
  - force-lock: Lock the device remotely (for security)
  - wipe-data: Factory reset device remotely (for decommissioning)
  
  These are minimal policies required for Device Owner mode. Additional
  policies can be added as needed for enhanced device management.
